# Statistical Learning

This machine learning project was part of the [Statistical Learning](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/122141/statistical-learning) module.
<br>
It focuses on model selection using the bias-varianc tradeoff, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
<br>
<br>
This project achieved **top grades** for both the report and code.

- **Please open:**
  - [Project report (PDF)](https://github.com/ValentinK214/leiden_public/blob/main/Statistical-learning_project-1/SL_Report.pdf)

- **Description:**
  - Part A: Showcase your AI model selection skills on simulated data
  - Part B: Uncover underlying trends in a real-life dataset of 30 personality traits
  - For detailed information, see the [assignment questions](https://github.com/ValentinK214/leiden_public/blob/main/Statistical-learning_project-1/SL_assignment_questions.pdf). 


- **Achievements:**
  - Received a **very high grade** for my report and code
  - Showcased deep understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff
  - Successfully identified the [Big 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) personality traits
  - Ran all machine learning models effectively in R

- **Key Learnings (Technical) :**
    - **Model Selection Process**: For supervised learning, it's crucial to consider:
        - Dataset dimensionality and noise
        -  Model assumptions, such as the shape of the decision boundary and penalty terms
        - Goal of the analysis, so interpretation versus prediction
    - **Cross-Validation**: Used for hyperparameter tuning and estimating the Expected Prediction Error.
    - **R Libraries**: How to run K-nearest neighbors (KNN) analysis and LASSO logistic regression.
    - **Latent Variables**: Best uncovered using rotated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) rather than classical PCA.
    - **Top Principal Components (PCs)**: The importance of considering multiple "top PCs" rules, as different rules return different numbers of top components.
    - **Clustering Techniques**: K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture clustering serve as "advanced descriptive statistics".
    - **Unsupervised Learning**: Interpretations can be highly subjective.
