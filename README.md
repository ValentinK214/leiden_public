Welcome to my repository showcasing academic projects from my MSc in Statistics &amp; Data Science program.

# SCwR Projects

The two projects presented below are part of the [Statistical Computing with R](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/121707/statistical-computing-with-r) module.

Feel free to explore each project folder for more details.

## Project 1: Custom Expectation-Maximisation Algorithm Implementation

- **Description:**
  - Detailed information about this project can be found in the file called [assignment.pdf](https://github.com/ValentinK214/leiden_public/blob/main/SCwR-EM_algo/Assignment.pdf). In summary, the goal was to develop the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm from scratch for mixed model parameters estimation, using only the lecture slides.
  - Achievements: Achieved 99% accuracy on simulated data and 52% on the provided dataset.

- **Special Emphasis:**
  - Please check the detailed report: [SCwR_A3](https://github.com/ValentinK214/leiden_public/blob/main/SCwR-EM_algo/kodderitzsch_valentin_SCwR_A3.pdf).

- **Interesting Sections from the Report**
    - Ex 2, part 3, log-likelihood function implementation
    - Ex 2, part 4, EM algorithm implementation
    - Ex 2, part 6, EM convergence check
    - Ex 2, part 7, EM comparing estimates to observed parameters
    - Ex 2, part 10 with 12, EM classification accuracy
    - Testing, log-likelihood test using parametric bootstrap
    - Testing, EM algorithm convergence check & classification accuracy (99%)
    - Learnings 

- **Key Technology:**
  - R

## Project 2: Comprehensive Summary of all Data Visualization Types

- **Description:**
  - This project involves creating a comprehensive document in preparation for the Statistical Computing with R exam. It covers the interpretation of all mono and bivariate visualization types.

- **Special Emphasis:**
  - Explore the document: [Summary of Visualization Types](https://github.com/ValentinK214/leiden_public/blob/main/SCwR-data_viz/all_visualistions_doc.pdf).
