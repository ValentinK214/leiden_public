# Causal Inference Coursework

This group project was part of my [Causal Inference](https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/courses/122091/causal-inference-i) module. Our team of 3 received high marks for both our report and code.

- **Abstract:**
    - > In this report we investigate the causal relationship between anti-hypertensive medication (BPMEDS) and risk of death among participants in the Framingham Heart Study [1]. Our research aims to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of taking BPMEDS via G-computation modeling. We found that there is a positive ATE of 8.2% points. However, important assumptions of our model are believed to be violated, raising doubts about the validity of the estimate.

- **Objective:**
    - Understand the effects of blood pressure medication on mortality risk 

- **Method:**
    - Used G-computation modeling to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE)

- **Outcome:**
    - Found an increased risk of death, but also identified potential model limitations

- **Achievements:**
    - Developed a clear research question as a team
    - Created a sensible causal diagram (shown above)
    - Applied and coded advanced statistical methods (G-computation, propensity score weighting)
    - Critically evaluated results and acknowledged limitations

- **Key Learnings:**
    - Finding causal relationships is challenging without experimental data
    - Unmeasured factors can significantly impact results
    - Working as a team of researchers is fun, especially when you get to bounce ideas and make judgement calls as a group
